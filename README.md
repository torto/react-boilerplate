# Project Torto Boilerplate

## Technologies to front

- React: Lib single application
- Redux: Work with stories in the React
- Axios: Execute all requests
- Styled Components: CssInJs
- Webpack 4: A bundler for javascript
- Babel: Javascript compiler
- Jest: Test all JavaScript code
- React-thunk: Async middleware for Redux.
- Enzyme: Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse your React Components' output.
- Storybook: UI component dev & test: React, React Native, Vue, Angular, Ember & more!

I didn't use react-lazyload because this project is very small, but if it is necessary to the project is very easy to implement after.
